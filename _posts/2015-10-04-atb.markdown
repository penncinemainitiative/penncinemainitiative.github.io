##Around the City

####**This Week at the Ritz**

As few films come and few go, we wish to highlight some that might be worth your attention this week.

The **Ritz Five**, is showing the sociopolitical tearjerker [Coming Home](http://www.landmarktheatres.com/philadelphia/film-info/coming-home), which follows a Chinese woman who is seperated from her husband when he is sent to a forced labor camp. He returns years later only to find she has been struck with amnesia, remembers little of her past, and patiently awaits her husband's return.

For a more mainstream release, the Ritz Five is also showing [Pawn Sacrifice](http://www.landmarktheatres.com/philadelphia/film-info/pawn-sacrifice), which promises a strong performance from Toby Maguire and looks to be an overall solid drama.
